# SantoshYadavDev

I started using Twitter in 2018, and my handle was `Santosh19742211` it was the default username created and I didn't knew how to change it.

Around 2020 my friend `AlexOkrushko` asked me what those numbers are, and suggested me to go with `SantoshYadavDev`

Now I use the same hanlde everywhere and it did wonders, in last 1.5 years my twitter connection went from under 3k to 16k.
