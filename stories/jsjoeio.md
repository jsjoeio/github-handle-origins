# jsjoeio

Long ago (maybe 2017?), I used to go by jjprevite online. However, I didn't have the handle across all social medias. One night, I couldn't sleep. I was going through a branding crisis after years of using "JavaScript Joe" as my name on Twitter.

"Something needs to change." I thought to myself.

Since I couldn't sleep that night, I decided to do some searching. "jsjoe" wasn't available on most platforms. "Shoot...what do I do????"

I decided to take inspiration from someone I admire - levelsio - and landed on "jsjoeio." 

I made the change in 2018 and haven't looked back since.
